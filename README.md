# Speed Typing Game

A speed typing game built with Next.js, Tailwind and Upstash RedisReact and TypeScript

## Description

A speed typing game that calculates the typing speed in Words per Minute (WPM). For each test, 60 random words are generated from data that is stored in Redis.
The game starts automatically when the user starts typing. The user has 60 seconds to type as many words as possible. After 60 seconds the time runs out and the test is 
finished. The score in WPM is calculated and all the incorrect words are highlighted in red. All words that are not typed are considered incorrect. The user can start a 
new game by pressing Reset. There is a language selector to switch between type tests in English and Dutch.
